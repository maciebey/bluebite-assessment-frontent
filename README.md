# Macie Bey - Blue Bite Frontend Assessment

Submission for Blue Bite coding assessment. Thanks for your time and consideration!

Notes:
- moved icons to public folder just for ease of access
- used some icons in place of missing ones from mockups, since already gone over alotted time
- kept all components in App.tsx also for time, can look at my other public react projects for how I usually  organize React projects
- simple state management, again can see Redux use in other projects
